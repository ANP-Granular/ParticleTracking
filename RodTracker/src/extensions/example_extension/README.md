This is an example on how to build an extension. It showcases the (major) 
features of the extension mechanism of the RodTracker.

Delete the `DEACTIVATED` file to let the RodTracker load this extension during
its startup phase.
(Re-)Create an empty file called `DEACTIVATED` to deactivate this or any other
extension.
