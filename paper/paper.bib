  abstract  = {Strongly driven granular media are known to undergo a transition from a gas-like to a cluster regime when the density of particles is increased. However, the main mechanism triggering this transition is not fully understood so far. Here, we investigate experimentally this transition within a 3D cell filled with beads that are driven by two face-to-face vibrating pistons in low gravity during parabolic flight campaigns. By varying large ranges of parameters, we obtain the full phase diagram of the dynamical regimes reached by the out-of-equilibrium system: gas, cluster or bouncing aggregate. The images of the cell recorded by two perpendicular cameras are processed to obtain the profiles of particle density along the vibration axis of the cell. A statistical test is then performed on these distributions to determinate which regime is reached by the system. The experimental results are found in very good agreement with theoretical models for the gas-cluster transition and for the emergence of the bouncing state. The transition is shown to occur when the typical propagation time needed to transmit the kinetic energy from one piston to the other is of the order of the relaxation time due to dissipative collisions.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional granular gas of ellipsoids is established by exposing the system to the microgravity environment of the International Space Station. We use two methods to measure the dynamics of the constituent particles and report the long-time development of the granular temperature until no further particle movement is detectable. The resulting cooling behavior can be well described by Haff’s cooling law with time scale τ. Different analysis methods show evidence of particle clustering towards the end of the experiment. By using the kinetic theory for ellipsoids we compare the translational energy dissipation of individual collision events with the overall cooling time scale τ. The difference from this comparison indicates how energy is distributed in different degrees of freedom including both translation and rotation during the cooling.},

abstract={Dilute ensembles of granular matter (so-called granular gases) are nonlinear systems which exhibit fascinating dynamical behavior far from equilibrium, including non-Gaussian distributions of velocities and rotational velocities, clustering, and violation of energy equipartition. In order to understand their dynamic properties, microgravity experiments were performed in suborbital flights and drop tower experiments. Up to now, the experimental images were evaluated mostly manually. Here, we introduce an approach for automatic 3D tracking of positions and orientations of rod-like particles in a dilute ensemble, based on two-view video data analysis. A two-dimensional (2D) localization of particles is performed using a Mask R-CNN neural network trained on a custom data set. The problem of 3D matching of the particles is solved by minimization of the total reprojection error, and finally, particle trajectories are tracked so that ensemble statistics are extracted. Depending on the required accuracy, the software can work fully self-sustainingly or serve as a base for subsequent manual corrections. The approach can be extended to other 3D and 2D particle tracking problems.},
